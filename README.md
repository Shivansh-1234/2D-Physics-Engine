# 2D-Physics-Engine
A 2D Physics Engine written in C++ and SDL

Still a work in progress : Look for branches for current status

Features Currently implemented : 
Forces - 
  Drag force
  Spring Force
  Friction Force
  Gravitational Force

Collision - 
  Detection : 
      AABB collisions
      SAT collisions
  Resolving :
      Projection Method
      Impulse Method


Currently uses Euler integration for applying forces, still have to implement Verlet integration
